However, he is viewed negatively in the Twelver Shia tradition.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\nUmar was born in Mecca to the Banu Adi clan, which was responsible for arbitration among the tribes. His father was Khattab ibn Nufayl and his mother was Hantama bint Hisham, from the tribe of Banu Makhzum. In his youth he used to tend to his father\\'s camels in the plains near Mecca. His merchant father was famed for his intelligence among his tribe. Umar himself said: \"My father, al-Khattab, was a ruthless man. He used to make me work hard; if I didn\\'t work he used to beat me and he used to work me to exhaustion.\"\\nDespite literacy being uncommon in pre-Islamic Arabia, Umar learned to read and write in his youth. Though not a poet himself, he developed a love for poetry and literature. According to the tradition of Quraish, while still in his teenage years, Umar learned martial arts, horse riding and wrestling. He was tall, physically powerful and a renowned wrestler. He was also a gifted orator who succeeded his father as an arbitrator among the tribes.\\nUmar became a merchant and made several journeys to Rome and Persia, where he is said to have met various scholars and analyzed Roman and Persian societies. As a merchant he was unsuccessful. Like others around him, Umar was fond of drinking in his pre-Islamic days.\\n\\n\\n== Early military career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Opposition to Islam ===\\nIn 610, Muhammad started preaching the message of Islam. However, like many others in Mecca, Umar opposed Islam and even threatened to kill Muhammad. He resolved to defend the traditional polytheistic religion of Arabia. He was adamant and cruel in opposing Muhammad, and very prominent in persecuting Muslims. He recommended Muhammad\\'s death. He firmly believed in the unity of the Quraish and saw the new faith of Islam as a cause of division and discord.\\nDue to persecution, Muhammad ordered some of his followers to migrate to Abyssinia. When a small group of Muslims migrated, Umar became worried about the future unity of the Quraish and decided to have Muhammad assassinated.\\n\\n\\n=== Conversion to Islam and service under Muhammad ===\\nUmar converted to Islam in 616, one year after the Migration to Abyssinia.\\nThe story was recounted in Ibn Ishaq\\'s Sīrah.

Directing the war from the city of Medina in Arabia, Umar\\'s quick conquest of Persia in a series of coordinated and multi-pronged attacks became his greatest triumph, contributing to his reputation as a great military and political strategist. In 644, however, he was assassinated by the Persian craftsman Abu Lu\\'lu\\'a Firuz, who had been captured by Rashidun troops and brought to Arabia as a slave.\\nSome Iranian historians have defended their forebears by using Arab sources to illustrate that \"contrary to the claims of some historians, Iranians, in fact, fought long and hard against the invading Arabs.\" By 651, most of the urban centres in Iranian lands, with the notable exception of the provinces along the Caspian Sea (i.e., in Tabaristan and Transoxiana), had come under Muslim domination. Many localities fought against the invaders; although the Rashidun army had established hegemony over most of the country, many cities rose in rebellion by killing their Arab governors or attacking their garrisons. Eventually, military reinforcements quashed the Iranian insurgencies and imposed complete control. The Islamization of Iran was gradual and incentivized in various ways over a period of centuries, though some Iranians never converted and there is widespread evidence of Zoroastrian scriptures and all other Pre-Islamic being systematically burnt and Zoroastrian priests being executed, particularly in areas that were centers of resistance. Islam had become Iran\\'s predominant religion by the Late Middle Ages; the majority of Iranians were Sunni Muslims until the Safavids forcefully converted Iran to Shia Islam in the 18th century.\\n\\n\\n== Historiography and recent scholarship ==\\n\\nWhen Western')),\n",

Announcing the launch during his Friday sermon, he stated: I would like to make an announcement and that is that an Ahmadiyya Encyclopaedia has been created and will be launched today; it has been prepared by the Central Ahmadiyya Archive & Research Centre.\\nThey began work on it some time ago and now, by the grace of Allah the Almighty, this website is being made available... It is available on www.ahmadipedia.org, where a homepage containing a search engine will open and can be used to search for information...\\n\\n\\n== Content ==\\nAhmadiPedia is edited by a team of editors at the ARC which draws on the primary sources of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community for its content. The encyclopedia entries give concise information but provide links and references to the Community\\'s literature for further study.\\nUsers have also been given the option to provide material via the \\'contribute\\' page, which is then edited and uploaded to the website by the editors.\\n\\n\\n== Censorship of AhmadiPedia ==\\nPakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) regularly blocks content from Ahmadiyya websites, including AhmadiPedia.org. Hence, just over a month into its launch, AhmadiPedia was blocked in Pakistan.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nFriday Sermon mentioning the launch of AhmadiPedia\\nKhalifa Launches AhmadiPedia (MTA International news report via YouTube)\\nAn introduction to AhmadiPedia (YouTube)\\nAl Hakam news report on the launch of AhmadiPedia'))]"
